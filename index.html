<p>Eduardo Pieta tried reading on an iPad. He liked it well enough, but went back to reading print books for two little reasons: Camilla, 6, and Caterina, 3.</p>
<p>He wants to set a good example for his daughters. "They associate the tablet with games and video," he says. "When they see me on the iPad, they think I'm playing. I want them to understand that reading is a serious activity. So I'm buying books again."</p>
<p>He is not the only one.</p><div class="photo">Photo</div>

<div id="boxfloat"><p> Kids are being regarded as a promising and rising market for mobile applications and e-books, with <a href="http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ilearnii.pdf"> more than half of the best-selling education apps in iTunes in 2011 targeting toddlers and preschoolers</a>. The percentage of children reading e-books has also nearly doubled between 2010 and 2012, according to a <a href="http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/new-study-kids-reading-digital-age-number-kids-reading-ebooks-has-nearly-doubled-2010">study released this year by the children's publisher Scholastic.</a></p>
<p>Even so, kids' e-books in no way threaten the market for the old-fashioned kind with colorful covers and picture-filled pages.</p>	
<p>A Jan. 2014 Nielsen study shows that the market share in dollars for kids' print books is on the rise, from 30 percent in 2011 to 34 percent in 2013 of the total print books market.</p>

<p>The Scholastic study cited above states that 58 percent of 9- to 17-year-olds say they will always want to read print books even when there are e-books available. It also says that only four percent of parents prefer that their children read ebooks instead of print books.</p></div><br />
<div class="story"><p>And the sales numbers don't lie. The eighth installment of Jeff Kinney's "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series sold over three million copies, making it the best-selling hardcover book of 2013, according to the <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/61447-for-children-s-books-in-2013-divergent-led-the-pack-facts-figures-2013.html"> Publisher's Weekly annual ranking</a>. The hardcover bestseller in the adult category, Dan Brown's "Inferno", had a little over half that number in sales.</p>

<p>New York City's two non-chain bookstores specializing in children's literature have gone through a recent rough patch, but the threat of closing doors wasn't due to lack of interest or declining sales.</p>
<p>Bank Street Books' problems started 10 years ago, when the rent outpaced the growth of the Upper West Side store, according to manager Andy Laties. "We were self-sustainable until the early 2000s," he says.</p>

<p>But when the rent got too high, the board of trustees of the Bank Street College of Education needed to find a solution. The future of the store seemed uncertain for a while, but last September, the college announced that Bank Street Books had found a new location with a cheaper rent, and it would move from its present location to a new one on the corner of West 107th Street and Broadway in February 2015.</p>
<p>Books of Wonder also suffered from rent problems. Since 2004, the 34-year-old store had shared its 5,000-square-foot West 18th Street location with Cupcake Cafe&#769;. But in the summer of 2011, the subtenant left the space. For the next 15 months, the owner, Peter Glassman, paid the full rent on his own while looking for another subtenant.</p>

<p>"It just depleted our resources. Basically, we were one bad month away from losing it all. And I realized you don't wait until you are on the verge of closing to ask for help, you ask for help when you see it on the horizon. It wasn't as we were going to close the next day, but we had no cushion left," he says.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to Peter Glassman describe how he founded Books of Wonder:</strong></p>
	<div id="audio"><iframe width="96%" height="120px" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/595247&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe></iframe></div>
<div class="chart">Chart</div>
<p>So Glassman launched in the fall of 2012 a crowdfunding campaign that raised $100,000. At the same time, he found a new subtenant for the space. That way, the crisis was averted.</p>

<p>Financially, things are better for Books of Wonder. Glassman celebrated a 51 percent increase in his business in September, when compared to the same month last year.</p>

<p>"Actually, from March to September we saw an average of 55 percent increase in business comparing to the same months of last year," he says.</p>

<p>But the market still depends on the health of the economy. Children rarely buy books for themselves, and when money is tight, presents are one of the first things that parents must cut back on.</p>

<p>"It is primarily a gift market," says Manuela Soares, professor in the Master in Publishing program at Pace University. "And children's bookstores are a destination. You go and take a child to browse through books," she explains.
That is exactly the case of Books of Wonder, Glassman says. "In the mid-'90s, we were already a destination store."</p>

<p>Bank Street Books has a good selection of educational toys, classroom decorations and teacher supplies, as well as a space for birthday parties and it hosts 600 events per year. But the main bread and butter is still print books, says Laties. "I would say 70 percent of our business is books."</p>

<p>Books are also a big part of the Pieta household. Two full bookcases go all the way to the ceiling of the living room and the girls' bedroom has shelves full of books, as well as two tiny armchairs where they sit to browse through picture books in English and Portuguese.</p>   

<p>There are books even in the least bookish room in their Long Island City house. In the TV room, where there is a large screen television set on a bench and a white couch opposite it, the walls are decorated with a patterned wallpaper that also simulates shelves full of books.</p>

<p>This reverence for books is reflected in the girls' daily routine.</p>

<p>"There is always the story moment during bedtime," Marcia, Eduardo's wife, explains. "And once a week, on Thursdays, the afterschool time is dedicated to reading." The tools always are print books, never a Kindle or iPad.</p><div id="chart2">chart 2</div>

<p>For Glassman, e-books never meant a true disruption to his business, only the introduction of a new format, like paperbacks in the 1930s. "The thing is, nobody in the book industry ever predicted that e-books would take over. The people who were saying this were the technologists."</p>

<p>And for the children's book market, e-books have not been an influence at all, says the bookstore owner. Actually, they might have opened an entirely new market. As Glassman puts it: "E-books are a great way for adults not to be embarrassed to be seen with a children's book."</p>
